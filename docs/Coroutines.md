# Coroutines — what to know for an interview

Ordered roughly by how likely it is to come up. Every code example is from this repo.

## 1. The one-sentence answer

A coroutine is a **suspendable computation**: a block of work that can pause at defined points and resume later, without blocking the thread it was running on.

The interview follow-up is always *"so how is that different from a thread?"* A thread is an OS resource — expensive, preemptively scheduled, a fixed stack. A coroutine is an object on the heap. One thread can run thousands of coroutines; a suspended coroutine occupies no thread at all. That is the whole value proposition: **concurrency without the cost of a thread per unit of work.**

## 2. `suspend` — what the compiler actually does

`suspend` is not a threading instruction. It is a marker that says "this function may suspend, so it can only be called from somewhere that knows how to resume it."

The compiler rewrites a `suspend fun` using **CPS (continuation-passing style)**:

- It adds a hidden `Continuation` parameter — the callback holding "what to do when this resumes."
- It compiles the function body into a **state machine**: each suspension point becomes a label, and locals that live across a suspension point become fields on the state machine object.
- The function returns either its value, or the sentinel `COROUTINE_SUSPENDED`.

Two consequences worth stating out loud in an interview:

1. **`suspend` alone does not move work off the main thread.** A `suspend fun` that runs a tight CPU loop will freeze the UI exactly like a normal function. Off-thread work needs a **dispatcher**, not the keyword.
2. **There is no reflection or magic and no extra thread per call.** Suspension is a return, and resumption is a call. That is why coroutines are cheap.

## 3. Structured concurrency — the actual big idea

Every coroutine has a parent. A parent cannot complete until its children complete; cancelling a parent cancels every child; a failing child (by default) cancels its parent and its siblings. There are no orphans and nothing leaks.

This is why `GlobalScope` is effectively banned — it has no parent, so nothing can cancel it and nobody waits for it. This repo uses it zero times.

`coroutineScope { }` is the building block: it suspends until all children finish, and it re-throws the first failure. `ProfileViewModel.load` uses it to fan out four requests and wait for the lot:

```kotlin
private suspend fun load() {
    _loadError.value = null

    ignoreErrors(_loadError) {
        coroutineScope {
            launch { userRepository.refresh(userId) }
            launch { profileRepository.refresh(userId) }
            launch { saved.refreshIfLoaded() }
            launch { liked.refreshIfLoaded() }
        }
    }

    _hasLoaded.value = true
}
```

`_hasLoaded` is set on the line after the block — and that line cannot run until all four requests are done. Structured concurrency is what makes that sequencing free.

**`coroutineScope` vs `supervisorScope`**: in `coroutineScope`, one child's failure cancels its siblings. In `supervisorScope`, children fail independently. Pick `coroutineScope` when the results are one unit of work (the four refreshes above — a half-loaded profile is not worth showing) and `supervisorScope` when they are independent.

`viewModelScope` is built on a `SupervisorJob` plus `Dispatchers.Main.immediate`, and is cancelled in `onCleared()`. That cancellation is the reason a ViewModel never leaks a request past the screen.

## 4. Dispatchers and main-safety

A dispatcher decides which thread a coroutine resumes on.

| Dispatcher | Backed by | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `Main` | Android UI looper | Touching UI / state read by UI |
| `Main.immediate` | same | As above, without a re-dispatch if already on Main |
| `IO` | elastic pool (64+ threads) | **Blocking** calls — disk, files, sockets, JDBC |
| `Default` | pool sized to CPU cores | **CPU-bound** work — parsing, sorting, image math |
| `Unconfined` | caller's thread | Testing and rare edge cases; do not reach for it |

`withContext(dispatcher) { }` switches for a block and switches back. The convention is **main-safety**: a `suspend fun` is responsible for its own threading, so the caller never has to know. That is why data sources here look like this:

```kotlin
override suspend fun read(uri: String): FileUpload = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
    // genuinely blocking: ContentResolver + InputStream
}
```

A nuance worth knowing, because it makes a good interview answer: **Retrofit `suspend` functions are already main-safe.** Retrofit enqueues on OkHttp's own dispatcher and resumes your coroutine when the response lands — it never blocks the calling thread. So `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)` around a bare Retrofit call is redundant (harmless, but it says you think the call blocks). It *is* required around `FileLoader` and `VideoMetadataReader`, which really do block. The rule: **`Dispatchers.IO` is for blocking APIs, not for "things that are slow."**

## 5. Cancellation is cooperative

Cancelling a coroutine sets its `Job` to cancelling; it does not kill a thread. The coroutine actually stops at its next **suspension point**, because every suspending function in the stdlib checks for cancellation on resume and throws `CancellationException`.

Three things follow:

- **A tight CPU loop with no suspension point is uncancellable.** Call `ensureActive()` or `yield()` inside it, or check `isActive`.
- **`CancellationException` must be re-thrown, never swallowed.** It is an ordinary `Exception` on the JVM, so a blanket `catch (e: Exception)` will eat it and break structured concurrency — the parent then thinks the child finished normally. This is exactly what `catchErrors` guards:

```kotlin
suspend fun catchErrors(onError: (Exception) -> Unit = {}, block: suspend () -> Unit) {
    try {
        block()
    } catch (e: CancellationException) {
        throw e
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        Timber.w(e)
        onError(e)
    }
}
```

- **Cleanup in `finally` cannot suspend** in a cancelled coroutine — a suspension there throws immediately. If cleanup must suspend, wrap it in `withContext(NonCancellable)`.

Cancellation is also a *feature*, not just a safety net. `dropReport` cancels an in-flight report when the dialog closes, so a response nobody is waiting for cannot settle into the *next* dialog:

```kotlin
fun dropReport(jobRef: KMutableProperty0<Job?>, setState: (ReportSendState) -> Unit) {
    jobRef.get()?.cancel()
    jobRef.set(null)
    setState(ReportSendState.IDLE)
}
```

And cancellation is not the same as failure. `PostRepository.toggleLike` treats them differently on purpose — a cancelled like keeps its optimistic value, because the request is already on the wire; only a real failure reverts.

## 6. `launch` vs `async`, and how exceptions travel

| | `launch` | `async` |
|---|---|---|
| Returns | `Job` | `Deferred<T>` |
| For | fire-and-forget | a value you will `await()` |
| Failure surfaces | immediately, up the parent chain | on `await()` — **and** immediately to the parent, if the parent is a `coroutineScope` |

The classic gotcha: **`async` at the root of a scope swallows an exception until you `await`.** Inside `coroutineScope`, it does not — the failure cancels the scope right away.

Parallel decomposition is `async` + `await`, as in `NetworkProfileDataSource.refresh`:

```kotlin
override suspend fun refresh(userId: UserId): ProfileRefreshData = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
    val statsDeferred = async { api.getProfileStats(userId).data }
    val postsDeferred = async { api.getUserPosts(userId) }

    ProfileRefreshData(
        postsCount = statsDeferred.await().postsCount,
        page = postsDeferred.await().toPage(),
    )
}
```

Both requests start before either is awaited — that is the point. Awaiting the first on the line that starts it would serialize them.

`CoroutineExceptionHandler` only works on a *root* coroutine (installed on the scope, or on a `launch` whose parent is a `SupervisorJob`). Installing one on a child is a no-op — the failure has already gone to the parent.

## 7. Flow

**A `Flow` is cold**: the block does not run until someone collects, and each collector gets its own run. `StateFlow` and `SharedFlow` are **hot**: they exist and emit whether or not anyone is listening.

| | `StateFlow` | `SharedFlow` |
|---|---|---|
| Initial value | required | none |
| Replay | always 1 (the current value) | configurable |
| Dedup | yes — conflates by `equals` | no |
| Good for | UI state | one-shot events |

`StateFlow`'s equality-based conflation is why UI state should be a `data class`: a `copy` that changes nothing is not re-emitted.

**Exposing state from a ViewModel** is the standard question. The answer here:

```kotlin
fun <T> Flow<T>.stateInWhileSubscribed(scope: CoroutineScope, initialValue: T): StateFlow<T> =
    stateIn(scope, SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(5_000), initialValue)
```

`WhileSubscribed(5000)` keeps the upstream alive for 5 seconds after the last collector leaves. That number is chosen to span a configuration change: rotate the screen and the upstream is *not* torn down and restarted. Leave for a minute and it is. The alternatives are `Eagerly` (collects forever, does work nobody reads) and `Lazily` (starts on first collector, never stops).

The collector side must match: `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()` stops collecting below `STARTED`. Plain `collectAsState()` keeps collecting while the app is backgrounded, which is what makes `WhileSubscribed` pointless.

Other operators worth naming: `flowOn` (changes the dispatcher of everything **upstream** of it), `combine` (re-emits when *any* source emits), `distinctUntilChanged`, `conflate`, `debounce`, and `flatMapLatest` (cancels the previous inner flow — the search-as-you-type operator).

## 8. Shared mutable state

Coroutines do not make race conditions go away. Two rules cover most of it:

1. **Confine the state to one place** and mutate it atomically. `MutableStateFlow.update { }` is a compare-and-set loop, so this is safe under concurrent callers:

```kotlin
_entities.update { it + (postId to updated) }
```

2. **Re-read before you write.** Reading an entity, suspending, then writing that stale snapshot back is a real bug this repo hit: a refresh that landed mid-flight got overwritten by the older copy. `PostRepository.updateEntity` re-reads inside the update and touches only the fields it owns.

Related, and a good thing to have an opinion about: **out-of-order responses.** Two like taps in flight should settle on the *second* one. The guard is a predicate checked at reconcile time:

```kotlin
val stillOurs = { post: Post -> post.isLiked == liked }
```

If a newer tap has already moved the value, the older response is dropped instead of applied. For the other case — where the second call should simply not happen — `launchIfIdle` single-flights it:

```kotlin
fun ViewModel.launchIfIdle(jobRef: KMutableProperty0<Job?>, block: suspend () -> Unit) {
    if (jobRef.get()?.isActive == true) return
    jobRef.set(viewModelScope.launch { block() })
}
```

`Mutex` (`withLock`) exists for the cases neither covers. It is a suspending lock, so it never blocks a thread. Prefer confinement first.

## 9. Testing

`runTest` gives you a **virtual clock**: `delay(10_000)` returns instantly, so a test of a timeout takes microseconds.

- **`StandardTestDispatcher`** queues coroutines; nothing runs until you call `advanceUntilIdle()` or `runCurrent()`. Use it when you need to assert on an intermediate state — the loading spinner *before* the response lands.
- **`UnconfinedTestDispatcher`** runs eagerly to the first suspension point. Use it when you only care about the end state. It is the default here.
- **`backgroundScope`** is for collectors that never complete. Launching an infinite `collect` in the test scope hangs `runTest` forever; `backgroundScope` is cancelled when the test body ends.
- **`Dispatchers.Main` does not exist on the JVM**, so anything using `viewModelScope` needs it replaced. That is `MainDispatcherRule` in `testing/`, which calls `Dispatchers.setMain` / `resetMain` around each test.
- **Inject dispatchers rather than hardcoding them** when a test needs to control them. Test doubles here are hand-written fakes; no mocking framework.

## 10. Rapid-fire

- **Coroutine vs thread?** A coroutine is a heap object scheduled by a library; a thread is an OS resource scheduled by the kernel. Many coroutines share one thread.
- **Does `suspend` make it async?** No. It makes the function *suspendable*. Dispatchers make it off-thread.
- **Why not `GlobalScope`?** No parent, so no cancellation and no completion guarantee. It leaks.
- **`launch` vs `async`?** Side effect vs value. `async` without `await` is usually a bug.
- **`Job` vs `SupervisorJob`?** Under a plain `Job`, one child's failure cancels its siblings. Under a `SupervisorJob`, it does not.
- **Why did my `catch` break cancellation?** `CancellationException` is an `Exception`. Re-throw it.
- **`Dispatchers.IO` vs `Default`?** Blocking vs CPU-bound. The IO pool is large because its threads are mostly parked.
- **Cold vs hot flow?** Cold restarts per collector and is inert without one; hot exists independently.
- **`WhileSubscribed(5000)`?** Survives a configuration change, stops for a real backgrounding.
- **How do you cancel a CPU loop?** `ensureActive()` or `yield()` inside it — otherwise nothing can.
